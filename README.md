# EventEase Platform - Frontend

## Overview

EventEase is a platform for managing events and attendees, featuring user authentication, event management, and real-time updates. The frontend of the platform is built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for interacting with events.

The platform allows users to register for events, view event details, and receive real-time notifications when there are updates to the events they are interested in.

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - User registration and login pages built using Next.js.
  - Persistent user session and personalized content based on the authenticated user.

- **Event Dashboard**:
  - A page displaying a list of events with a form for creating and registering for events.

- **Real-Time Notifications**:
  - Real-time updates when a new attendee registers for an event or when an event reaches its maximum capacity.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Tailwind CSS is used to ensure that the frontend is responsive across different devices.

## Deployment

The frontend is deployed and available at:

- **Live URL**: [https://event-ease-next.vercel.app/](https://event-ease-next.vercel.app/)

You can view the platform live, interact with the events, and sign up or log in as a user.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v7 or higher)

## Installation

## Real-Time Notifications with Socket.IO

The frontend uses **Socket.IO** to listen for real-time updates from the backend. The following events are broadcasted and displayed:

- **attendee-registered**: This event is triggered when a new attendee registers for an event.
- **event-full**: This event is triggered when an event reaches its maximum capacity.
- **event-updated**: This event is triggered when an eventâ€™s details are updated.

```js
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL);

socket.on('attendee-registered', (data) => {
  // Handle real-time update when a new attendee registers.
});

socket.on('event-full', (data) => {
  // Handle real-time update when an event is full.
});

socket.on('event-updated', (data) => {
  // Handle real-time update when event details are updated.
});
```
